=============================
The above line is not a part of the format

As per URI specification, "a component is undefined if its delimiter does not appear in the URI reference. Path is never undefined", or something like that. Therefore, if a component is undefined its line doesn't appear, and if it is defined, but is empty, after the colon goes a single spacebar, and then immediately a newline. All percent-encodings that needn't be percent encoded should be normalized, all capitalization should also be normalized where specified by URI specification. A path takes up multiple "fields", each representing a path segment, which may be empty. If a path is empty, it will not be included at all, to make a distinction with a path that has a single empty segment (third example)
